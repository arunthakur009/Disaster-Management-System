# 🌍 Disaster-Management-System

## 📌 Overview  
The **Disaster Management System** is a web-based platform that provides **real-time disaster response, resource tracking, and emergency communication tools**. The system is designed to help affected individuals, government agencies, and NGOs coordinate relief efforts effectively.

## 🚨 Why This Project?  

Most disaster-related deaths do not occur during the disaster itself but **after the disaster** due to the following issues:  

### 1️⃣ **Lack of People Tracking**  
   - Authorities cannot locate affected individuals.  
   - There is a gap between the **reported number of people** and the **actual count of affected individuals**.  
   - Survivors struggle to find **safe evacuation routes** to shelters.  

### 2️⃣ **Limited Resource Awareness**  
   - People in safe locations **do not know** where to find **food, medical aid, and emergency services**.  
   - Critical resources such as **water, medical kits, and rescue teams** are not easily accessible.  

### 3️⃣ **Inefficient Communication During Crisis**  
   - Authorities fail to broadcast warnings to **remote areas**.  
   - No centralized platform for sharing **verified updates and emergency instructions**.  
   - Victims cannot reach out for help due to network failures.  

### 4️⃣ **Slow Response Time for Rescuers**  
   - First responders do not have **real-time data** on the most affected areas.  
   - Delays in **dispatching rescue teams** and sending medical aid.  
   - Lack of **automated SOS detection** based on social media or mobile data.
